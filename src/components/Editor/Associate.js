              Welcome to the online edition of Aravali Journal of Technical Research (AJTR).
              This year marks a milestone in the history of the journal because
              it comes with some important enhancements. The enhancement is that
              the journal is reshaped according to the internal standard and UGC
              norms. This will enable faster processing rate of the articles and
              gives us scope to include more articles. To get best benefits out
              of this improvement, we encourage more practice-based articles,
              state-of-the-art content and critical review articles. This will
              help us in scoring high in performance measures and moving up in
              journal ranking lists. We have also modified the journal to
              reflect the aim and scope of AJTR. We continue to publish excellent
              articles, and our rejection rates are much higher compared to many
              top journals. It is time for us to look at the journal as truly
              international and continue to work hard to help the journal in
              climbing up the ranking ladder. We do not believe in rushing into
              shortcuts that might work in getting more citations for the
              articles. Instead, we should find better articles that discuss new
              ideas and research directions, original articles that can create
              deep interest in the readership of the journal and content that
              the researchers do not want to miss. I thanks to our mentor Dr
              Dr. Jitendra Singh Chouhan, HOD CS, Aravali Institute of Technical Studies, my
              Editor. I am also thankful to our reviewers and
              editors for their valuable suggestion.
